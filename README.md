# Blusys HAL

Blusys HAL is a simplified C HAL for ESP32 devices built on top of ESP-IDF v5.5.

The first release targets:
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-S3

Project goals:
- simpler than ESP-IDF for common embedded tasks
- modular and maintainable internally
- stable public API and documentation
- common API surface across C3 and S3 for v1

This repository currently contains the project planning and documentation baseline before implementation starts.

- use `mkdocs serve` for preview
